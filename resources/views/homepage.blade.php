    <h6> This is the Aston Events website for Aston students. It is used to promote the events
        organised within university. Events are classified into three types: sport (e.g. football, swimming, cricket
        etc.), culture (e.g. Hindu, Jewish, Chinese etc.) and others (music, photography etc.). Each event is
        described by its name, description, time, picture, organiser, contact, venue etc. Every student can view the
        events listed in the web page and show interest to an event. A student could register in the website and
        become an event organiser who will be able to publish an event with text description and picture(s). An
        event organiser can organise several events.
